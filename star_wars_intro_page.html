                    <p>As the movie starts, awfully familiar music plays and quite recognizable font style starts to flow.
                    User is overwhelmed: is he visiting a simple web page or starts to watch a movie without even knowing it?
                    Indeed, as you can notice, this is just web page that was styled in theme of my favourites movie introduction - Star Wars.</p>
                    <p>I'm big fan of sci-fi things and due to my professional field I really like to implement different designs
                    towards theme itself.</p>
